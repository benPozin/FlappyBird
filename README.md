## Overview
Welcome to my version of the classic Flappy Bird game! This project is a simple yet fun implementation of the popular Flappy Bird gameplay mechanics using Java and the Swing library for the graphical user interface. The goal is to guide a bird through a series of obstacles by tapping a key to make the bird flap its wings and avoid crashing into pipes.

## Features
- Classic Flappy Bird Gameplay: Navigate the bird through endless pipes and try to achieve the highest score possible.
- Randomized Obstacles: Pipes appear at different heights to keep the gameplay challenging and unpredictable.
- Collision Detection: The game accurately detects collisions between the bird and pipes or the ground, leading to game-over scenarios.
- User Input Handling: The bird flaps its wings in response to key presses, providing a responsive and engaging experience.
- Simple Graphics: Lightweight graphics for quick rendering and a smooth gameplay experience.

## How to Play
- Use the W key to make the bird flap its wings and fly higher.
- Avoid hitting the pipes or the ground to keep playing.
- The longer you survive, the higher your score!

## Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or later recommended).

## Technologies Used
- Java: The core programming language used for game logic.
- Swing: Java's GUI toolkit used for rendering graphics and handling user input.
- ImageIO: For loading and displaying images of the bird and pipes.

## Future Improvements
- Add background music and sound effects for a more immersive experience.
- Implement a more effective scoring system to track and display the player's high score.
- Introduce additional obstacles and power-ups to diversify gameplay.
